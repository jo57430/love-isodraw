(love) lib isodraw : (discontinued 2021) Unfinished library, allowing to manage mathematical operations to create an isometric world on love.

I don't now if it work, don't contact me to fix bugs. It's old, abandoned, and poorly coded. 
I just put it here to have a backup, and that some person can look at it for their similar project.
